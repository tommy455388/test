                            <h3>Descriptions found in historical texts include a statement in a book titled “Supplementary Notes on the Wild Territories” written by Yu Yonghe during the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty (1697): “Yushan is king among ten thousand mountains. Its mountains are unique and high. It can be seen from afar. It is steep and craggy. It is white as silver. From afar, it looks like snow from the heavens. It is surrounded by peaks on all sides. It is unreachable. It is said that this mountain is as solid as jade.”<br>
                                During the Japanese colonial era in Taiwan, the Japanese found that Yushan was taller than Mount Fuji in Japan, so in the 30th year of the Meiji era, the Emperor Meiji named it “Mount Niitaka”. During the Republic of China era, the name of the mountain was announced as Yushan on December 1, 1947.<br>
                                Yushan has been a very important mountain for the indigenous people since ancient times, and is considered a sacred mountain by the Bunun and Tsou people.</h3>
                            <p><span>Bunun</span>The Bunun people call Yushan “Tongu Saviec”, meaning “mountain of refuge”, because the Bunun say that in ancient times, when the land was flooded, only Yushan still offered shelter.</p>
                            <hr>
                            <p><span>Tsou</span>According to legend, their ancestors lived at the top of Yushan and called it “pattonkan”, which transliterated to “Batongguan” in Chinese. It means “shining mountain” or “mountain of quartz”.</p>
